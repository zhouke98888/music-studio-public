  - Lesson (with status management)
  - Invoice (monthly billing)
  - Instrument (inventory management)
  - Message (notifications)

- **API Endpoints**
  - Authentication routes (/api/auth/*)
  - Lesson management routes (/api/lessons/*)
  - Instrument management routes (/api/instruments/*)
  - Proper error handling and validation

- **Middleware**
  - Authentication middleware
  - Role-based authorization
  - CORS configuration

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Material-UI)
- **Authentication**
  - Login component with username/password
  - Registration component with role selection
  - Protected routes
  - Auth context for state management

- **Layout & Navigation**
  - Responsive sidebar navigation
  - Role-based menu items
  - User profile dropdown
  - Material-UI theme integration

- **Dashboard**
  - Welcome screen with user-specific content
  - Quick stats cards
  - Upcoming lessons display
  - My instruments (for students)
  - Quick actions (for teachers)

- **Core Infrastructure**
  - API service layer with Axios
  - TypeScript types for all data models
  - React Router for navigation
  - Context-based state management

## 🚀 Ready to Use Features

### For Students:
1. **Register/Login** - Create account and sign in
2. **Dashboard** - View upcoming lessons and checked-out instruments
3. **Navigation** - Access to lessons, invoices, and instruments sections

### For Teachers:
1. **Register/Login** - Create teacher account and sign in
2. **Dashboard** - View upcoming lessons and quick actions
3. **Navigation** - Access to students, lessons, invoices, and instruments management

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Starting Development
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

# Start both backend and frontend
npm run dev

# Or start separately:
npm run server  # Backend on port 5000
npm run client  # Frontend on port 3000
```

### Testing the Application
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Register as a student or teacher
3. Explore the dashboard and navigation
4. Test API endpoints at http://localhost:5000/api

### Adding New Features
1. **Backend**: Add models → controllers → routes
2. **Frontend**: Add types → API services → components → pages
3. **Integration**: Update navigation and routing
